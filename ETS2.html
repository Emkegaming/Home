                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Gameplay follows an open world style, with players being essentially free to travel anywhere in their lorries, provided they can keep up with fuel, maintenance and toll costs, alongside fines if they incur any. When starting out, players choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities. At first, the player can only take what is known as Quick jobsâ€”these jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered. As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start accepting better-paying jobs by using their own truck instead of being a driver for hire with gear being supplied. Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring NPC drivers to take on deliveries, buying more garages and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and drivers. The skills of the drivers hired by the player also grow with experience and the player can create a huge fleet of the trucks and drivers expanding the business across Europe.
<div>
</div><div>As players progress and earn money, they are also able to purchase their own trailers, which can be fully customized in the same way as trucks. Player-owned trailers can be used to receive and deliver cargo at existing storage locations. Like trucks, trailers can also be allocated to company employees, resulting in higher income.
</div><div>The player gains experience points after each delivery. A skill point is awarded after each level-up. Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different ADR classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, deliveries that are urgent and eco-driving. This progression allows the player to take on better-paid jobs.
</div><div>The base game features 71 cities in twelve countries, over twenty types of cargo and over fifteen fictional European companies. There are seven map DLCs that expand the game to more countries and locations, and multiple other truck and trailer DLCs.
</div><div>The game also features a "Radio" feature, which allows players to play imported MP3 and OGG files. It also allows the player to listen to Internet radio.
</div><div>The game includes two new truck companies, Scania and Renault, with MAN returning from the original game. Initially, DAF, Iveco, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo trucks were not officially licensed and had their names changed to DAV, Ivedo, Majestic and Valiant respectively. Later updates included the official branding for the DAF XF, Volvo FH, Iveco Stralis, Scania Streamline and Mercedes-Benz Actros. In 2017 the new Scania S and R were introduced. The MAN TGX Euro 6 was added as a playable vehicle on 8 February 2019, followed by the Renault T on 26 September 2019. On 6 April 2021, Renault Trucks unveiled their new T-High range of trucks through a joint venture with SCS Software, becoming the first time a new truck has been announced through a video game.</div><div>
